# Traffic-Signs-Classification
This project aims at classifying traffic signs.
The dataset used comes from Kaggle (gtsrb-german-traffic-sign) 
and contains more than 50 000 images classified into 43 different classes.
The dataset is quite varying, some classes have many images,
while others have few images. There are two folders : 
the train folder with training images in it and the test folder 
with images that will be used for testing.
